# Tufts (Summer) REU

This README and this repository introductory material for starting research with the Tufts Neutrino Group.

## Getting Setup

To work in our group, you'll need a 
* Tufts Affiliate Account
* Tufts HPC access
* Access to the our groups cluster storage

You'll also need to
* Open a github account, if you don't have one.
* Send me your github account to be added to our group's github organization.
* Get addded to the group slack and email list.

### Affiliate Account

If already a Tufts student, you can skip this step.

I (Taritree) am the person to request an account for you.  What I'll need is:

* Your name
* Your email address
* Your birth day and month (but not the year)

After I submit the request, you should receive an email from IT to finish the procedure.

Once you finish the procedure, you can ask for a Tufts ID badge to get access to the department building. 
We can also request access to the office area and my lab, if needed.

### Tufts HPC Access

The next thing you'll neeed is an account to the Tufts High Performance Cluster (HPC). The majority of our code and data live there.

To request an account, go to the [Tufts HPC website](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing), scroll down a little, and then click on the 'Cluster Account Request' button.

After signing in with your Tufts credentials, there will be a form with the following entries:

* Phone Number:
* Department: Physics and Astronomy
* Research Group Name: Wongjirad Lab
* Advisor/Supervisor/PI Name: Taritree Wongjirad

Select the radio button 'New Cluster Account Request'. 

You'll get an email, usually, that will request approval from me. Both you and I will be on the email. If I don't respond after half a day, don't hestitate to remind me to respond.

### Cluster storage access

Usually, the IT folks will also give you access to our lab's cluster storage area. If not the case, then after you get your cluster account, re-login to this form, re-fill the form, and the submit with the 'Research Storage Request ...' button on.

You'll get an email, usually, that will request approval from me. Both you and I will be on the email. If I don't respond after half a day, don't hestitate to remind me to respond.
