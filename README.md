# Tufts (Summer) REU

This README and this repository introductory material for starting research with the Tufts Neutrino Group.

## Pre-requisities

If not aready a Tufts student, you'll need a Tufts Affiliate Account. I am the person to get the process started in requesting an account for you.  What I'll need is:

* Your name
* Your email address
* Your birth day and month (but not the year)

After I submit the request, you should receive an email from IT to finish the procedure.

After getting a Tufts account or if you're already a Tufts student, the next thing you'll neeed is an account to the Tufts High Performance Cluster (HPC).

To request that account, go to the [Tufts HPC website](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing), scroll down a little, and then click on the 'Cluster Account Request' button.

After signing in with your Tufts credentials, there will be a form with the following entries:

* Phone Number:
* Department: Physics and Astronomy
* Research Group Name: Wongjirad Lab
* Advisor/Supervisor/PI Name: Taritree Wongjirad

Select the radio button 'New Cluster Account Request'. 

Usually, the IT folks will also give you access to our lab's cluster storage area. If not the case, then after you get your cluster account, re-login to this form, re-fill the form, and the submit with the 'Research Storage Request ...' button on.
